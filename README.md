# Google-Playstore-Analysis
üìä Introduction üöÄ

Google Play Store is renowned as one of the largest and most popular  app stores worldwide. With its extensive collection of apps and a large of data, it presents an optimal opportunity to analyse data and identifying trends and future challenges

The goal is to analyze the Google Play Store Apps dataset to derive insights into the app market. Aim to understand the factors that contribute to an app's success, including its user ratings, reviews, and category. We want to explore user sentiments towards apps by analyzing the user reviews dataset. Additionally, we can see insights into the popularity of app categories based on the total number of installs and the sentiment polarity of user reviews. The ultimate objective is to provide recommendations for app developers to enhance their app's performance and user satisfaction.


üìà INSIGHTS GENERATED:<br>
<li>There are total 33 app categories in this dataset and total number of distinct apps in these categories are 8k.</li>
<li>Type of these apps can be paid or premium.Free apps are 92.12% of the dataset, while paid apps constitute 7.81%.</li>
<li>A positive correlation exists between installs and rating.</li>
<li>The average rating of apps on the Play Store is 4.0, indicating a satisfactory overall quality.</li>
<li>The top 3 apps by categories in terms of installs on the Play Store are "Family," "Game," and "Tools."</li>
<li>‚ÄúGame‚Äù category stands in top 2 position having highest number of installs for both paid and free app types.</li>
<li>When the app is free, the percentage of positive sentiments is greater than negative sentiments but for paid apps negative sentiments are more</li>

<br>
üí°CONCLUSION FROM THE INSIGHTS GENERATED:<br>
<li>Most of the apps are free so developers should focus on creating free apps to have a huge customer base.If developing paid apps then its price should not be high. </li>
<li>In order to retain the customer base apps should be updated regularly Developers should develop apps such that their content is available for everyone.</li>
<li>Bulky apps should be developed in the category like Game, Family since they have high number of installs and positive sentiments</li>
<br>
<li>These are some of the aspects that the developer should research before proceeding with the app development. By conducting a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the play store dataset, we not only eliminate avoidable risks of failure, but we may also be able to provide better ideas for building the app.</li>
